# ColorWizard Landing Page — Raw Copy

## Hero Section

### Headline
**A color picker that doesn't spy on you or charge you for the good stuff.**

### Subheading

## The Problem (Section 1)

### You're Tired of

- **Subscription traps** masquerading as "free tiers" (Photoshop, I'm looking at you)
- **Vendor lock-in** where you can't export your own work
- **Slow, bloated tools** that should be instant
- **Privacy theater** — your images going to some server so they can sell your data
- **Color picking bullshit** — the old browser tab → screenshot → clipboard dance

You just want to sample a color from a reference image and get the paint recipe. That's it. Why is that hard?

---

## The Solution (Section 2)

### ColorWizard

- **Free to use.** Actually free. No crippled version. No paywalls for basic features.
- **No sign-up.** No email. No account. No password.
- **Your data stays yours.** Images never leave your machine. We don't see them. We don't store them.
- **Fast.** 50% faster than the alternatives. Click → result. Instant.
- **Export everything.** Your paint recipes, color cards, palettes. PNG, JSON, CSV. All yours.
- **Open source.** Read the code. Audit it. Fork it. Build on it.

### What You Get

Click any color in any image.

ColorWizard gives you:

1. **Oil Paint Recipe** — mixing ratios using a 6-color limited palette (the way real painters work)
2. **DMC Floss Matches** — embroidery thread colors for cross-stitch
3. **Color Name** — what it's actually called (from 30k+ real color names)
4. **Reference Card** — exportable PNG for your studio
5. **Peace of Mind** — no tracking, no selling, no surprises

## How It Works (Section 4)

### Step 1: Upload
Drag and drop an image. Or click to browse. Or paste from clipboard.

### Step 2: Click
Click any color on the canvas. That's it.

### Step 3: Use
- Copy the paint recipe
- Export a reference card
- Export the palette
- Take what you need and go

---

## For Painters (Section 5)

### Stop the Hunting

You know the workflow:
1. Find a reference image online
2. Open browser developer tools
3. Use the color picker
4. Manually calculate paint mixing ratios
5. Try the mix on a palette
6. Repeat 20 times
7. Give up and just guess

### Now

1. Open ColorWizard
2. Click the color
3. You get the recipe
4. Paint

That's it. No hunting. No math. Just work.

---

## For Illustrators (Section 6)

### Color Consistency

Upload your sketch. Sample a handful of colors. Export the palette. Use it in Procreate. Every illustration stays consistent with your reference.

Procreate plugin coming soon. No switching apps. Just sample and paint.

---

## The Price (Section 7)

### Free Tier
- Unlimited color sampling
- Paint recipes
- DMC matches
- Color naming
- Export everything
- Forever

### Pro Tier ($8/month)
- Batch palette extraction
- Cloud palette sync
- Custom paint libraries
- Procreate plugin

**The core tool is free.** We're not hiding the good stuff behind a paywall. If you just need to sample colors and get recipes, you never have to pay.

---

## Philosophy (Section 8)

### We Built This Because

We got tired of:
- **Slow tools** that should be instant
- **Privacy violations** disguised as features
- **Subscription models** that treat features as hostages
- **Vendor lock-in** that makes you feel trapped

So we built the opposite.

### Open Source DNA

The code is yours. The design patterns are yours. The entire approach is reproducible. If we disappear tomorrow, you still have your recipes. The tool still works. Nothing changes.

This is what happens when a painter and an engineer decide to build something together instead of letting corporate interests dictate the roadmap.
