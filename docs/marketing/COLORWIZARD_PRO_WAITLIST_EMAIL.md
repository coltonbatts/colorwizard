---

### Email Body:

Hi [First Name],

Welcome to the ColorWizard Pro early access program.

You've joined a small group of painters, designers, and illustrators testing the next version of ColorWizard. Your feedback will shape how we build it.

**Here's what you get:**

✅ **30 days free** of Pro features (normally $8/month)
✅ **Batch palette extraction** — Upload an image, extract every color at once
✅ **Cloud sync** — Mix on desktop, access your palettes on iPad
✅ **Custom paint libraries** — Early access to Acrylic and Watercolor palettes
✅ **Direct line to me** — Reply to this email with feedback. I read every message.

**Your access link:** [PERSONALIZED_LINK]

Your password reset code: [CODE]

(This link expires in 24 hours. If it doesn't work, reply here and I'll resend.)

---

### What Happens After 30 Days?

Your Pro membership will convert to a paid subscription ($8/month or $70/year). You can cancel anytime—no questions asked. If you want to cancel before the trial ends, just let me know.

**No surprises. No hidden charges.**

---

### What We're Building

ColorWizard started as a simple tool: click a color, get your paint recipe. In a few weeks, you couldn't do that without signing up. You couldn't sync palettes between devices. You couldn't batch-extract colors from full images.

Now you can.

We're building this in public. If you follow [@thecoltonbatts](https://twitter.com/thecoltonbatts) on Twitter, you'll see ship updates every two weeks. Real metrics. Real code changes. Real thinking.

---

### Help Us Get Better

ColorWizard is only useful if it solves *your* problems. So:

- **Try the new features.** Break things. Tell me what doesn't work.
- **Suggest improvements.** What's missing? What's confusing?
- **Use it in your actual workflow.** Lab testing is one thing. Real work is another.

Reply to this email with anything. Questions, bugs, ideas, frustration. All of it helps.

---

### Quick Start

1. Click your access link (above)
2. Log in with the password reset code
3. Explore the new features in the Pro tier
4. Upload an image and try batch palette extraction
5. Let me know what you think

Everything else works the same. Your old palettes are still there. Your free tier data didn't change.

---

### What's Next?

- **Week 1:** Batch extraction bug reports (tell me what breaks)
- **Week 2:** Cloud sync testing (mix on desktop, check iPad)
- **Week 3:** Custom paint libraries (Acrylics + Watercolor test)
- **End of month:** Feedback synthesis + next ship

We're iterating fast. Expect updates.

---

### Questions?

Reply here. I respond to every email.

Thanks for being part of this.

— Colton

P.S. If the access link doesn't work, reply with "reset" and I'll send a new one.

## Email 2: First Week Check-in (Triggered after 3 days of first login)

**Subject:** "How's ColorWizard Pro working for you?"

**From:** colton@colorwizard.app

**Preview Text:** "Used batch extraction yet? Thoughts?"

---

### Email Body:

Hey [First Name],

Hope you've had a chance to explore the Pro features. Curious how it's going so far.

**Quick question:** What's the most useful thing about Pro so far? (Or what's broken?)

I'm reading every reply. Seriously. This feedback shapes what ships next.

If you haven't tried batch palette extraction yet, here's what it does:

1. Upload an image
2. Click "Extract All"
3. ColorWizard generates mixing recipes for *every color* in the image
4. Export as a color collection

Takes 30 seconds instead of manually sampling 50 colors.

Saves time. That's the whole point.

---

### One Ask

If you're finding ColorWizard useful, could you share it with one other creative person? Just send them [colorwizard.app](https://colorwizard.app).

No sign-up required. They'll get the free tier. If it helps them, cool. If not, no harm.

Growing slowly. Organically. With actual users who find it useful.

---

### What's Next?

Next week: Cloud sync test. (Mix on desktop, see your palettes appear on iPad instantly.)

Week after: Custom paint libraries. (Acrylics this week, Watercolor soon after.)

Stay tuned.

## Email 3: Week 2 Feature Deep-Dive (Triggered after 7 days)

**Subject:** "Cloud Sync is live. Here's why it matters."

**From:** colton@colorwizard.app

**Preview Text:** "Your palettes are everywhere now."

---

### Email Body:

Hey [First Name],

Cloud sync is now live in Pro.

Here's what that means: Mix a palette on your Mac. Pick up your iPad. Your palettes are there.

**How to use it:**

1. Mix a color on desktop
2. Save it to your Palette Library
3. On iPad, open ColorWizard and log in
4. Your palettes sync automatically

No exporting. No files. Just there.

---

### Why This Matters

Most design tools force you to sync workflows manually. Export. Upload. Import. Sync again.

ColorWizard just does it.

This is the boring, powerful feature that shows we're thinking about *how you actually work*.

---

### Known Limitations

- Sync takes ~2-5 seconds (we're optimizing)
- Works on desktop + iPad (Android coming next month)
- First sync can take longer if you have 100+ palettes

Let me know if you hit issues.

---

### Coming Next

**Acrylics + Watercolor palettes.** (End of week)

Currently ColorWizard only has the limited oil palette. But if you work in acrylics or watercolor, we're adding those this week.

This is real. Not vaporware. Already tested internally.

---

### Feedback So Far

People are telling me:

> "Cloud sync changed how I work. Now I can reference colors on the go."

> "Batch extraction saved me an hour yesterday."

> "The iPad experience just works."

This is founder energy. This is what we're building toward.

## Email 4: End of Trial (Triggered 2 days before trial expires)

**Subject:** "Your 30-day trial ends in 2 days. Here's what's next."

**From:** colton@colorwizard.app

**Preview Text:** "Keep Pro or go back to free. Your choice. No pressure."

---

### Email Body:

Hey [First Name],

Your 30-day Pro trial expires in 2 days.

After that, your Pro membership converts to a paid subscription ($8/month). You'll be charged on [DATE].

**But here's the thing: You have options.**

### Option 1: Keep Pro
Stay subscribed. Keep using batch extraction, cloud sync, and custom paint libraries. Pay $8/month (or $70/year if you prepay).

No lock-in. Cancel anytime. I mean it.

### Option 2: Go Back to Free
Cancel the subscription. You'll keep the free tier forever. Unlimited color sampling, paint recipes, exports. No payment ever.

Your old palettes stay. You just lose batch extraction and cloud sync.

To cancel: Reply here with "cancel" and I'll turn off the subscription immediately.

### Option 3: Ask Questions
Not sure? Want to know more about what's coming? Reply here.

---

### Why I'm Asking

I built ColorWizard for two reasons:

1. **It solves a real problem.** Painters, designers, and illustrators actually use it.
2. **I want to build this as a sustainable business.** Not to get rich. To keep building and shipping.

If Pro doesn't feel worth $8/month, I want to know why. Seriously.

But if it does? Staying subscribed lets me keep shipping features like cloud sync and custom palettes.

---

### What You've Seen So Far

In 30 days, we shipped:
- Cloud sync (works great)
- Batch extraction (saves hours)
- Performance optimization (2x faster)
- Early-stage Acrylic support

That's the shipping cadence if you stick around. Every 2-3 weeks, something ships.

---

### The Real Question

Is it worth $8/month for features that save you time?

If yes: Stay. Keep building with ColorWizard.
If no: Cancel. No hard feelings. Seriously.

Reply with your decision. Or just let me know if you want to stay but need help.

— Colton

P.S. If you have friends who'd find this useful, [send them the free tier](https://colorwizard.app). No payment. No strings.

## Email 5: Post-Conversion Win (Triggered after successful payment)

**Subject:** "Welcome to Pro. You're helping us build the future."

**From:** colton@colorwizard.app

**Preview Text:** "Your support means everything."

---

### Email Body:

Hey [First Name],

Your subscription is active. You're officially a ColorWizard Pro member.

Here's what that means: **You're part of the founding crew.**

You're not just a user. You're betting on this tool. You're saying "I think this is worth building."

That's huge. Thank you.

---

### What Happens Now

**You get the features.** Batch extraction. Cloud sync. Custom palettes. Direct email line to me for feedback.

**I get the resources.** Your subscription funds the server costs, the new features, the next tools.

**We both win.** You save time. I get to keep shipping.

---

### What's Coming

- **February:** Full Acrylic + Watercolor palettes
- **March:** Procreate plugin (sample colors directly in Procreate)
- **April:** CSV exports for designers and developers

Real stuff. Shipping soon. You'll see updates every two weeks on Twitter.

---

### One Ask

If ColorWizard saves you time or helps your work, tell someone. A fellow painter. A designer friend. Post on Twitter or Instagram.

Growing word-of-mouth beats VC money. Real users finding real value.

---

### Stay in Touch

Follow [@thecoltonbatts](https://twitter.com/thecoltonbatts) for shipping updates. Or just reply here with feedback.

I read everything. I respond to most things. This is a real relationship, not a mailing list.

---

### Thank You

For being part of this. For trying the features. For telling me what's broken.

You're helping build something real.
