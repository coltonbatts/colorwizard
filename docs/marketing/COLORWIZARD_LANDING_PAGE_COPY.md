## OPTIONAL: FAQ Section

**Q: Why oil paint? I don't paint.**
A: ColorWizard works for any color matching—designers use it for brand colors, illustrators use it for references, fiber artists use it for embroidery floss. The mixing recipes are just bonus.

**Q: Is my image uploaded to your servers?**
A: No. ColorWizard processes everything locally in your browser. Your images never leave your device.

**Q: What's the difference between Free and Pro?**
A: Free covers 90% of use cases (sample colors, get recipes, export cards). Pro adds batch extraction and cloud sync for power users. Start free, upgrade only if you need it.

**Q: Do you sell my data?**
A: No. We don't track users. We don't sell anything. We don't even ask for email until you ask to join Pro beta.

**Q: Can I use ColorWizard for commercial work?**
A: Yes. Sample away. The palettes you generate are yours to use.

## Visual Assets Needed

For the landing page, you'll want:
1. **Hero image:** ColorWizard interface on desktop + mobile (side-by-side)
2. **Feature illustrations:** Icon set for each feature (sampling, recipe, floss, naming)
3. **Testimonial screenshots:** (placeholder: "It just feels faster now")
4. **Performance chart:** Before/after metrics visualization
5. **Social proof:** User count or activity metric ("10,000+ palettes generated this month")

## Tone Guidelines

- **Friendly, not corporate:** "Click a color" not "Leverage sophisticated color sampling"
- **Honest about scope:** This is a tool. It solves a specific problem well.
- **Show the work:** Link to the performance blog. Mention shipping updates. Be transparent.
- **Founder voice:** This isn't a big company. It's one builder. Sound like it.
- **Action-oriented:** Free to try. No friction. Now.
