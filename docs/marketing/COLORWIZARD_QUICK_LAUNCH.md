## 📱 TUESDAY (Schedule Twitter Thread)

7 tweets ready to go:
1. Hook tweet
2. Problem tweet
3. Solution 1 (with code)
4. Solution 2
5. Solution 3

7. CTA + email signup

**Order matters** — Thread them together by replying to previous tweet

### Step 3: Add Images (Optional, 5 min)
- Use a screenshot of ColorWizard interface
- Performance chart (if you have one)
- Or just text tweets (totally fine for technical threads)

### Step 4: Schedule for 8am CT, Tuesday
- [ ] Set all 7 tweets to post at 8am CT, Tuesday (Jan 29)

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls (Don't Do These)

- ❌ Don't oversell the performance gains (50% is accurate, stick to it)
- ❌ Don't post the Twitter thread and then ghost (reply to comments!)
- ❌ Don't change your bios then post conflicting messages (consistency)
- ❌ Don't forget to add email signup to landing page (that's the funnel!)
- ❌ Don't set up email sequence then ignore it (respond to replies!)

---

## ✅ Success Looks Like

By next week:
- 20-50 new Twitter followers
- 10-20 email signups for Pro
- 100+ visits to blog post
- 5-10 questions/replies to Twitter thread
- At least 2-3 pieces of helpful feedback for next ship

Don't expect viral. Expect sustainable. Real builders noticing real work.
