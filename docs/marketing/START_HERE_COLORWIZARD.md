## 🎯 Key Principles

✅ **Ship credibly** — Real metrics, not hype  
✅ **Build in public** — Share the work, not just results  
✅ **Founder voice** — Authentic, not corporate  
✅ **Consistent** — Same message across all channels  
✅ **Product-first** — Everything links back to colorwizard.app  

---

## 🚨 Don't Do These Things

❌ Don't overthink the voice (it's authentic as-is)  
❌ Don't exaggerate metrics (50% is real, stick to it)  
❌ Don't delay implementation (ship this week)  
❌ Don't disappear after launch (respond to replies!)  
❌ Don't wait for perfection (80% good is ship-ready)
