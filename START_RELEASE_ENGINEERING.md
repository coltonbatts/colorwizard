# 🚀 START HERE - ColorWizard Release Engineering Handoff

Welcome! You're inheriting a comprehensive release engineering project for ColorWizard Pro ($1 lifetime purchase). This document gets you oriented in 5 minutes.

---

## What Just Happened?

A release engineering team (1 main agent + 4 specialized subagents) has **completed the pre-work** for shipping ColorWizard Pro with a hardened, polished entitlement system.

### Output Generated (Today)
✅ **9 comprehensive documents** created  
✅ **4 subagents** delivered specialized audits  
✅ **200+ lines of test code** written  
✅ **10+ component-level UI fixes** identified  
✅ **4-phase execution roadmap** ready

## Read These (In Order)

### 1️⃣ **This File** (You Are Here)
You're reading the quick-start guide. Proceed to #2 when ready.

### 2️⃣ **RELEASE_ENGINEERING_SUMMARY.md** (10 min read)
Executive summary of everything: what was found, what needs fixing, how long it takes.

### 3️⃣ **PHASED_RELEASE_PLAN.md** (The Master Plan)
Detailed 4-phase roadmap with exact file changes, verification checklists, and git checkpoints.

**Phases**:
- Phase 1: UX Polish (2-3h)
- Phase 2: Reliability (2-3h)
- Phase 3: Logging & Tests (1-2h)
- Phase 4: Cleanup & Docs (1-2h)

**Total**: 6-10 hours to ship-ready code

### 4️⃣ **TEST_PLAN.md** (QA Strategy)
How to verify tier gating works. Includes 40+ automated test cases + smoke test checklist.

### 5️⃣ **UI_PUNCH_LIST.md** or View Audit Results
Component-by-component design recommendations. Read when you get to Phase 1.

## The 3-Minute Reality Check

### ✅ What's Working
- Stripe checkout flow implemented
- Webhook handler implemented (idempotent)
- Feature gating logic correct
- Free tier genuinely free (no artificial limits)
- Database schema ready

### ⚠️ What Needs Work
- **UX**: Mobile responsiveness, loading states, error handling
- **Reliability**: No manual restore purchase option, tier caching missing
- **Logging**: No structured dev logs, generic error messages
- **Tests**: Only 1 test file, need ~40+ cases
- **Docs**: No release checklist, no rollback plan

### 🎯 Priority Order
1. **Phase 1 (UX)**: Most visible, highest impact on user experience
2. **Phase 2 (Reliability)**: Core entitlement safety
3. **Phase 3 (Tests)**: Build confidence before launch
4. **Phase 4 (Cleanup)**: Polish + documentation

## Quick Navigation

### By Role

**If You're the Release Engineer (Main Focus)**
1. Read RELEASE_ENGINEERING_SUMMARY.md
2. Read PHASED_RELEASE_PLAN.md (full context)
3. Execute phases in order
4. Reference ROLLBACK_PLAN.md + OPERATIONAL_NOTES.md when ready to launch

**If You're a Frontend Developer (Phase 1)**
1. Read PHASED_RELEASE_PLAN.md → Phase 1 section
2. Reference UI_PUNCH_LIST.md for specific component changes
3. Verify changes at 375px, 768px, 1440px breakpoints
4. Test with `npm test` before committing

**If You're a QA Engineer (Phase 3)**
1. Read TEST_PLAN.md
2. Review lib/__tests__/featureFlags.test.ts (example test structure)
3. Run `npm test` to see tests in action
4. Add more tests following the same pattern
5. Manual smoke tests on staging (checklist in TEST_PLAN.md)

**If You're on DevOps (Launch Day)**
1. Read ROLLBACK_PLAN.md
2. Read OPERATIONAL_NOTES.md
3. Verify Stripe webhook configured in production
4. Set up monitoring (Sentry, error tracking)
5. Pre-write incident runbooks from rollback plan

## Common Questions

### Q: How long until we can ship?
**A**: 4-7 days if you follow the phased plan. Fastest path: 3 days if you parallelize phases.

### Q: Do I need to change Stripe configuration?
**A**: No. Webhook is already configured in code. Just verify it's live in production before launch.

### Q: Can I skip any phases?
**A**: No. Each phase de-risks a critical area:
- Phase 1 = User confidence (UX)
- Phase 2 = Entitlement safety (Reliability)
- Phase 3 = Launch confidence (Tests)
- Phase 4 = Operational readiness (Docs)

### Q: What if tests fail during Phase 3?
**A**: Don't panic. Tests are catching regressions intentionally. Reference TEST_PLAN.md for debugging guidance. Most failures are simple fixes (bad mock, wrong tier value, etc.).

### Q: How do I rollback if something breaks in production?
**A**: Follow ROLLBACK_PLAN.md (coming from Docs subagent). TL;DR: Disable checkout button + revert tier changes + retry webhook.

### Q: Do I need Firebase emulator?
**A**: No. Unit tests use mocks. Firebase is only needed for manual smoke tests on staging (Phase 4 checklist).

### Q: Can I test with real Stripe?
**A**: Yes, use Stripe test mode (already configured in dev). Use test cards from Stripe docs.

## Tools You'll Need

- `git` (version control)
- `npm` / `node` (already installed)
- `vitest` (test framework - already configured)
- `TypeScript` (already configured)
- Stripe Dashboard (for webhook verification)
- Firebase Console (for manual tier checks)

No new tools needed!
