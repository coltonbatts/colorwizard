# The Perfect Next Prompt for ColorWizard

## Context: What We Just Built

ColorWizard is a privacy-first color tool for painters that just shipped:

- ✅ Procreate .swatches export (30 tests passing, production-ready)
- ✅ AR tracing with camera projection ($1 Pro tier, built but not live)
- ✅ Full Stripe + Firebase monetization infrastructure (dormant)
- ✅ Oil paint recipes with Spectral.js (6-color limited palette)
- ✅ DMC floss matching (454 threads)
- ✅ 50% performance boost from v1
- ✅ Zero tracking, client-side only

**The Product**: Open-source at github.com/coltonbatts/colorwizard, live at colorwizard.app

**The Ethos**: "$1 forever" Pro tier. No subscriptions. Eat DaVinci Eye's lunch ($30/year) at 1/30th the price.

**The Stack**: Next.js 15, React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind, Canvas API, Spectral.js, Web Workers, Stripe, Firebase

**The Gap**: Monetization is built but not activated. We need to flip the switch and start making money.

## The Prompt

You're a cracked indie hacker who ships fast and makes money. Think Levels.io, Pieter Levels, Marc Lou. You build in public, iterate ruthlessly, and optimize for revenue per hour of work.

ColorWizard has everything needed to make $10k/month:

1. **Product-market fit**: Artists love it (Reddit, Twitter validation)
2. **Monetization infrastructure**: Stripe + Firebase ready to go
3. **Competitive moat**: Open-source, privacy-first, $1 forever (vs $30/year competitors)
4. **Distribution channels**: Product Hunt, Reddit (r/painting, r/watercolor), Twitter art community
5. **Viral features**: Procreate export, AR tracing, DMC matching

**Your mission**: Activate monetization, launch Pro tier, and hit $1k MRR in 30 days.

### Phase 1: Activate Monetization (Week 1)

**Goal**: Get the first 10 paying customers

1. **Fix the pricing**:
   - Current: $9/month or $99/year (too expensive, wrong model)
   - New: **$1 one-time payment for Pro forever**
   - Why: Matches AR tracing pricing, removes friction, viral word-of-mouth
   - Implementation: Update Stripe products, remove subscriptions, add one-time payment

2. **Gate the killer features**:
   - Free: Basic color sampling, 5-color Procreate export, standard recipes
   - Pro ($1): Unlimited Procreate export (30 colors), AR tracing, custom palette names, value-sorted ordering, DMC export, batch operations
   - Add upgrade prompts at every friction point (not annoying, just clear value)

3. **Build the upgrade flow**:
   - Stripe Checkout for $1 one-time payment
   - Instant unlock (no email verification, just pay and go)
   - Celebratory confetti animation on unlock
   - "You're now a Pro user forever" message

4. **Test the funnel**:
   - Track: Free → Upgrade prompt → Checkout → Payment → Unlock
   - Goal: 10% conversion from upgrade prompt to payment
   - A/B test: Upgrade modal copy, pricing display, feature highlights

### Phase 2: Launch & Distribution (Week 2)

**Goal**: 1,000 users, 100 paying customers ($100 MRR)

1. **Product Hunt launch**:
   - Title: "ColorWizard - Procreate color picker for painters ($1 forever, open-source)"
   - Tagline: "Sample colors, get oil paint recipes, export to Procreate. No subscriptions, no tracking."
   - Media: GIF of Procreate export flow, AR tracing demo, before/after comparisons
   - Launch day: Wednesday (best for maker products)
   - Goal: Top 5 product of the day

2. **Reddit blitz**:
   - r/painting: "I built a free tool to match any color to oil paints (with Procreate export)"
   - r/watercolor: "Free color picker with DMC floss matching for embroidery reference"
   - r/procreate: "Export any color palette directly to Procreate ($1 forever, no subscription)"
   - r/SideProject: "ColorWizard - $1k MRR in 30 days challenge (open-source)"
   - Timing: Post on Sunday evenings (highest engagement)

3. **Twitter art community**:
   - Thread: "I'm eating DaVinci Eye's lunch with a $1 AR tracing app (they charge $30/year)"
   - Hook: "Artists hate subscriptions. So I built the opposite."
   - Include: Demo video, GitHub link, "built in public" narrative
   - Tag: @levelsio, @marc_louvion, indie hacker community
   - Goal: 10k impressions, 100 clicks

4. **YouTube demo**:
   - 2-minute walkthrough: "How to export Procreate palettes from any image"
   - SEO: "Procreate color picker", "oil paint mixing", "DMC floss matching"
   - CTA: "Try it free at colorwizard.app, upgrade for $1 to unlock everything"

### Phase 3: Optimize & Scale (Week 3-4)

**Goal**: $1k MRR (1,000 paying customers at $1 each)

1. **Conversion optimization**:
   - Add social proof: "1,234 artists upgraded to Pro"
   - Add urgency: "Limited launch pricing: $1 forever (normally $5)"
   - Add testimonials: Reach out to early users for quotes
   - A/B test: Upgrade modal timing (immediate vs after 3 exports)

2. **Viral loops**:
   - Add "Share your palette" feature (generates shareable link)
   - Add "Made with ColorWizard" watermark on exports (optional, removable for Pro)
   - Add referral system: "Invite 3 friends, get Pro free"

3. **Content marketing**:
   - Blog: "How to mix any color with 6 oil paints (Zorn palette guide)"
   - Blog: "The science behind realistic paint mixing (Spectral.js explained)"
   - Blog: "Why I'm charging $1 instead of $30/year (and making more money)"
   - SEO: Target "oil paint color mixing", "Procreate palette import", "DMC floss color matching"

4. **Community building**:
   - Discord server for Pro users (exclusive, high-value)
   - Weekly "Color Challenge" on Twitter (sample this painting, share your palette)
   - Feature user artwork on homepage (with permission)

### Phase 4: Expand Revenue (Month 2+)

**Goal**: $5k MRR

1. **Tiered pricing** (if $1 model caps out):
   - Hobbyist: $1 one-time (current Pro features)
   - Professional: $5 one-time (batch export, API access, commercial license)
   - Studio: $20 one-time (team sharing, custom branding, priority support)

2. **B2B opportunities**:
   - Art schools: Site license for $100/year (unlimited students)
   - Paint manufacturers: White-label version with their brand colors
   - Procreate: Partnership for official integration

3. **Upsells**:
   - Premium paint libraries: Gamblin, Golden, Old Holland ($1 each)
   - Custom palette presets: "Impressionist palette", "Portrait palette" ($1 each)
   - Advanced features: Batch palette extraction, cloud sync ($1 each)

4. **Affiliate revenue**:
   - Amazon affiliate links for recommended paint sets
   - Blick Art Materials partnership (commission on paint sales)
   - Procreate affiliate (if they have a program)

## The Execution Plan

**Day 3-4**: Build upgrade prompts, add social proof, optimize conversion
**Day 5-7**: Soft launch to email list, gather testimonials, fix bugs

**Day 8**: Product Hunt launch (Wednesday)
**Day 9-10**: Reddit blitz (Sunday evening posts)
**Day 11-14**: Twitter thread, YouTube demo, content marketing

## Why This Will Work

1. **Pricing psychology**: $1 is impulse-buy territory. No decision fatigue.
2. **Competitive advantage**: Open-source + privacy-first + no subscription = unbeatable
3. **Network effects**: Procreate export creates viral loop (artists share palettes)
4. **Timing**: Procreate is exploding, artists are fed up with subscriptions
5. **Distribution**: Reddit art communities are highly engaged, Product Hunt loves maker stories

**The pitch**: "I'm charging $1 instead of $30/year. And I'm going to make more money."

## Your Next Message to Me

"Let's activate monetization. Start with Phase 1: Update Stripe to $1 one-time payment, gate Pro features, and build the upgrade flow. Make it so good that artists feel guilty NOT paying $1."

Then we ship, launch, and hit $1k MRR in 30 days.

Let's fucking go. 🚀
